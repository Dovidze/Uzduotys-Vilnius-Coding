    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>
        Gere was born in <a href="">Philadelphia</a> on August 31, 1949,<sup><a href="">[4]</a></sup> the eldest son and second child of <a href="">homemaker</a> Doris Ann (<a href="">née </a> Tiffany; 1924–2016) and <a href="">NMIC</a> insurance agent Homer George Gere (1922–2023). <sup><a href="">[5]</a><a href="">[6]</a></sup> His father originally intended to become a <a href="">minister.</a><sup><a href="">[7]</a></sup> Gere was raised <a href="">Methodist</a><sup><a href="">[8]</a><a href="">[9]</a></sup> in <a href="">Syracuse</a>, <a href="">New York.</a><sup><a href="">[10]</a></sup> His paternal great-grandfather, George Lane Gere (1848–1932), changed the spelling of his surname from "Geer". One of his ancestors, also named George, was an Englishman who came from <a href="">Heavitree</a>, England, and settled in the <a href="">Connecticut Colony</a> in 1638. <sup> <a href="">[11]</a></sup> Both of Gere's parents were <a href=""><em>Mayflower</em></a> descendants; his ancestors include <a href="">Pilgrims</a> such as <a href="">John Billington</a>, <a href="">William Brewster</a>, <a href="">Francis Eaton</a>, <a href="">Francis Cooke</a>, <a href="">Degory Priest</a>, <a href="">George Soule</a> and <a href="">Richard Warren</a>. <sup> <a href="">[12]</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1967, Gere graduated from <a href="">North Syracuse Central High School</a>, where he excelled at gymnastics and music and played the trumpet. <sup> <a href="">[7]</a></sup> Gere attended the <a href="">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> on a gymnastics scholarship, studying philosophy; after two years, he left and did not graduate. <sup> <a href="">[7]</a><a href="">[13]</a></sup>  
    </p>
    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>
        Gere first worked professionally at the <a href="">Seattle Repertory Theatre</a> and the <a href="">Provincetown Playhouse</a> on Cape Cod in 1969, where he starred in <a href=""><em>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</em></a>. His first major acting role was in the 1971 rock opera <a href=""><em>Soon</em></a>, written by Scott Fagan and Joe Kookoolis, which opened on Broadway at the Ritz Theatre and closed after three performances. <sup><a href=""> [14]</a><a href="">[15] </a></sup>Following that, he appeared in the original London stage version of <a href=""><em>Grease</em></a>, in 1973. <sup> <a href="">[7]</a></sup> Gere was one of the first notable Hollywood actors to play a homosexual character, starring as a <a href="">gay Holocaust victim</a> in the 1979 <a href="">Broadway</a> production of <a href=""><em>Bent</em></a>, for which he earned a <a href="">Theatre World Award.</a> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Gere began appearing in <a href="">Hollywood</a> films in the mid-1970s. Originally cast in a starring role in <a href=""><em>The Lords of Flatbush</em></a> (1974), he was replaced after fighting with his co-star <a href="">Sylvester Stallone</a>. Gere played a small but significant part in <a href=""><em>Looking for Mr. Goodbar</em></a> (1977) and starred in director <a href="">Terrence Malick's</a> well-reviewed drama <a href=""><em>Days of Heaven</em></a> (1978). <sup><a href="">[7] </a></sup>The crime drama <a href=""><em>American Gigolo</em> </a>(1980) significantly boosted his profile and the romantic drama <a href=""><em>An Officer and a Gentleman</em></a> (1982) (co-starring <a href="">Debra Winger</a>) cemented Gere's ascent to stardom, grossing almost $130 million[16] and winning two <a href="">Academy Awards</a> out of six nominations; <sup> <a href="">[17]</a></sup> Gere himself received his first <a href="">Golden Globe Award</a> nomination. <sup> <a href="">[18]</a></sup> For the remainder of the 1980s, Gere appeared in films of varying critical and commercial reception. <sup><a href="">[19]</a><a href="">[20]</a></sup> His career rebounded with the releases of <a href=""><em>Internal Affairs</em></a> (1990) and <a href=""><em>Pretty Woman</em></a> (1990), the latter of which earned Gere his second <a href="">Golden Globe Award</a> nomination. <sup> <a href="">[21]</a> </sup>The 1990s saw Gere star in successful films including <a href=""><em>Sommersby</em></a> (1993) (opposite <a href="">Jodie Foster</a>), <a href=""><em>Primal Fear</em></a> (1996) and <a href=""><em>Runaway Bride</em></a> (1999) (which reunited him with his Pretty Woman co-star <a href="">Julia Roberts</a>). <sup> <a href="">[19]</a> </sup>He also took a leading role in the action thriller The <a href=""><em>Jackal</em></a> (1997), playing former IRA militant Declan Mulqueen; Gere affected an Irish accent for the role. <sup> <a href="">[22]</a> </sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        Gere was named <a href=""><em>People</em></a> magazine's <a href=""> "Sexiest Man Alive"</a> in 1999. Not long thereafter, all in the same year, he appeared in the hit films <a href=""><em>The Mothman Prophecies</em></a> (2002), <a href=""><em></em>Unfaithful</em></a> (2002), and the <a href="">Academy Award</a>-winning <a href="">musical film adaptation <em>Chicago </em></a>(2002),<sup><a href="">[7] </a></sup> for which Gere won his first <a href="">Golden Globe Award</a>. His <a href="">ballroom dancing</a> drama <a href=""><em>Shall We Dance?</em></a> (2004) was also a solid performer that grossed $170 million worldwide.<sup> <a href="">[23]</a> </sup> His next film, the <a href="">book-to-screen adaptation <em>Bee Season</em></a> (2005), was a commercial failure.<sup> <a href="">[24]</a> </sup> Gere went on to co-star with <a href="">Jesse Eisenberg</a> and <a href="">Terrence Howard</a> in <a href=""><em>The Hunting Party </em></a>(2007), a thriller in which he played a journalist in Bosnia. He next appeared with <a href="">Christian Bale</a>, <a href="">Heath Ledger</a> and <a href="">Cate Blanchett</a> in <a href="">Todd Haynes</a>' semi-biographical film about <a href="">Bob Dylan,<em>I'm Not There</em></a> (2007); Gere was one of six actors to portray a variation of Dylan. He co-starred with <a href="">Diane Lane</a> in the romantic drama <a href=""><em>Nights in Rodanthe</em></a> (2008). The film was widely panned by critics<sup> <a href="">[25]</a> </sup> (making #74 on The Times Worst Films of 2008 list),<sup> <a href="">[26]</a> </sup> but grossed over $84 million worldwide.<sup> <a href="">[27]</a> </sup> The film is his most recent to have been produced entirely by a <a href="">major film studio.</a> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Gere has expressed a belief that his politics regarding China, an important financial resource for major Hollywood studios, have made him <a href="">unwelcome within Hollywood.</a><sup> <a href="">[28]</a> </sup> Gere embraced his apparent exile from Hollywood and instead appeared in independent films that garnered some of the best reviews of his career.<sup> <a href="">[20]</a> </sup> Gere was notably singled out for portraying businessman Robert Miller in <a href=""><em>Arbitrage</em></a> (2012), earning his fourth <a href="">Golden Globe Award</a> nomination. Among many positive reviews,<sup> <a href="">[29]</a> </sup> <a href="">Peter Travers </a>of <a href=""><em>Rolling Stone</em></a> cited Gere's performance as "too good to ignore" and "an implosive tour de force".<sup> <a href="">[30]</a> </sup> Also in 2012, he received the Golden Starfish Award for Lifetime Achievement from the <a href="">Hamptons International Film Festival</a> and the Career Achievement Award from the <a href="">Hollywood Film Awards.</a><sup> <a href="">[31]</a> <a href="">[32]</a></sup> Gere had earlier received an award from the <a href="">34th Cairo International Film Festival</a> in December 2010.<sup> <a href="">[33]</a> </sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        Gere made a notable departure from his traditional screen persona with <a href="">Joseph Cedar</a>'s political drama <a href=""><em>Norman </em></a> (2016). The film saw Gere portray Norman Oppenheimer, a small-time Jewish <a href="">fixer</a>. Gere himself described the character as an embodiment of the "sides of us we know are annoying and needy".<sup> <a href="">[34]</a> </sup> His portrayal of Oppenheimer was called "consistently, completely fascinating" by <a href="">RogerEbert.com</a><sup> <a href="">[35]</a> </sup> and was singled out as a worthy <a href="">Academy Award</a> contender by <a href=""><em>Variety.</em></a><sup> <a href="">[36]</a> </sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        Gere is an accomplished musician, composing and performing the Pretty Woman piano theme and a guitar solo in Runaway Bride. He studied tap for three months to shoot half a day of dancing for his role as lawyer Billy Flynn in Chicago. <sup> <a href="">[37]</a> </sup>He also studied karate for An Officer and a Gentleman.<sup><a href="">[38]</a> </sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        Multiple film critics and media outlets have cited Gere as one of the best actors never to have received an <a href="">Academy Award</a> nomination. <sup> <a href="">[39]</a><a href="">[40]</a></sup>
